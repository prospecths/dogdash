&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imagine a group of friends, all students at Prospect High School, who share a love for wagging tails and furry cuddles. That's us! We've formed a special club dedicated to making a difference, not just in our school, but in the lives of animals who need our help.
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We're not just any club; we're a team of dedicated dog walkers, and we're on a mission! Every step we take, every happy pup we walk, brings us closer to our goal: to raise $1,000 for The Humane Society. This amazing organization works tirelessly to provide shelter, food, and care to animals who have been abandoned, lost, or simply need a helping hand.
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We believe that even small actions can create big changes. By combining our passion for dogs with our desire to give back, we're hoping to make a real impact on the lives of animals in our community.
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We're working hard, organizing walks, and spreading the word about our cause. We want to show everyone that high school students can make a difference. Every dollar we raise will go directly to The Humane Society, helping them continue their vital work of caring for animals in need.
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you'd like to join us in supporting this worthy cause, we'd be incredibly grateful! You can make a donation by visiting this link:<a href="https://tilt.fyi/QRQb0v1Bir" target="_blank" class="hsi-link">https://tilt.fyi/QRQb0v1Bir</a> or by scanning the QR code below.
